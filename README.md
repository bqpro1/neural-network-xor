# Neural Network XOR Implementation

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bqpro1/neural-network-xor/blob/main/simple_NN.ipynb)

This project implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to solve the XOR problem using PyTorch. The implementation includes visualizations of the decision boundary, weight matrices, and training process.

## Features
- Implementation of XOR using Neural Networks
- Visualization of decision boundaries
- Weight matrix visualization
- Flexible MLP architecture
- Training process visualization
